## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Firebase account
- SMTP email service (for sending notifications)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ping-pilot.git
cd ping-pilot
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Email Configuration (Nodemailer)
EMAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email-user
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
EMAIL_FROM=notifications@your-domain.com

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Run the development server with Turbopack**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

5. **Open your browser**

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Setting Up Firebase

1. Create a new Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore Database
3. Set up Authentication with Email/Password provider
4. Create the necessary Firestore collections:
   - `users`
   - `servers`
   - `serverStatus`

### Creating an Admin Account

Admin accounts are created by directly modifying the user's role in Firestore:

1. Create a normal user account through the application
2. In Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore
3. Find the user document in the `users` collection
4. Edit the document and change the `role` field value to `"admin"`

## Deployment

### Deployment

The project is optimized for Vercel deployment, which supports Next.js 15 and the App Router out of the box.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Configure your environment variables
5. Deploy the application

Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js configuration and deploy your application with the optimal settings.

For the best performance, Vercel's serverless functions will handle your API routes, and the Edge Network will serve your static content with minimal latency.

### Setting Up Scheduled Checks

To run regular server checks, set up a scheduled job:

1. For Vercel deployment, create a Vercel Cron Job:
   - Add the following to your `vercel.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "crons": [
       {
         "path": "/api/check-servers",
         "schedule": "* * * * *"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Alternatively, use an external service like UptimeRobot or cron-job.org to ping your API endpoints regularly.
